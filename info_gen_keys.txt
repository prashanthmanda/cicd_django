How to Get These Keys (SECRET_KEY, my-private-key, my-public-key)?
You need to generate or retrieve each of these keys based on your requirements. Below is a step-by-step guide for getting each key.

🔹 1️⃣ How to Get SECRET_KEY (Django Security Key)
🔸 Option 1: Generate a New SECRET_KEY (Recommended)
If you don’t have a SECRET_KEY, generate one using Python:

🔹 Method 1: Use Django's secrets Module
Run this command in a Python shell:

python
Copy
import secrets
print(secrets.token_urlsafe(50))
This will generate a random, secure SECRET_KEY.
Example output:
perl
Copy
Jx^!4H3m@#bV2$5fTzQW8NpK&xYzKpLd@TgCmJ9w6G
🔹 Method 2: Use Django Command
If you have Django installed, you can generate a key with:

sh
Copy
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
Example output:
perl
Copy
f34b$kjdfg9@8Zmn&h4lM9s8Kq#Yxg5P@6T7GvBpC
🔸 Option 2: Retrieve from an Existing Django Project
If your Django app is already running, check settings.py for:

python
Copy
SECRET_KEY = "your-existing-secret-key"
🔸 Store SECRET_KEY in AWS Secrets Manager
Once you have a SECRET_KEY, store it securely:

Go to AWS Console → Secrets Manager (AWS Secrets Manager)
Click "Store a new secret".
Select "Other type of secret".
Enter the key-value pair:
markdown
Copy
Key          | Value
-------------------------------
SECRET_KEY   | f34b$kjdfg9@8Zmn&h4lM9s8Kq#Yxg5P@6T7GvBpC
Click Next, set the secret name as "my-secret-key", and save.
🔹 2️⃣ How to Get my-private-key (EC2 SSH Private Key)
🔑 What is it?

The private key is used to connect to an EC2 instance via SSH.
If you already have an EC2 instance, you must use the private key that was created when launching it.
🔸 Option 1: Check If You Already Have a Private Key
Go to AWS Console → EC2 → Key Pairs (AWS Key Pairs)
Look for your key pair (e.g., my-ec2-key).
If you already have the private key file (my-ec2-key.pem), use that.
If you lost it, you must create a new key pair (see below).
🔸 Option 2: Create a New Private Key (If You Don’t Have One)
Go to AWS Console → EC2 → Key Pairs.
Click "Create Key Pair".
Choose:
Key Pair Name: my-ec2-key
Key Type: RSA (recommended)
Private Key Format: .pem
Click Create Key Pair → Download my-ec2-key.pem.
🔸 Store my-private-key in AWS Secrets Manager
Once you have the private key:

Go to AWS Secrets Manager → Store a new secret.
Select "Other type of secret".
Paste the private key as the secret value:
vbnet
Copy
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
your-private-key-content-here
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
Click Next, set the secret name as "my-private-key", and save.
🔹 3️⃣ How to Get my-public-key (EC2 SSH Public Key)
🔑 What is it?

The public key is used to verify SSH authentication on the server.
If you already have an existing EC2 key pair, you can extract the public key from the private key.
🔸 Option 1: Extract Public Key from Private Key
If you have the .pem private key file:

sh
Copy
ssh-keygen -y -f my-ec2-key.pem
Example output:
vbnet
Copy
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEA...your-public-key
🔸 Option 2: Check the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys File (on EC2)
If your EC2 instance already has an SSH key, log in and check:

sh
Copy
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
This will display the public key.

🔸 Store my-public-key in AWS Secrets Manager
Go to AWS Secrets Manager → Store a new secret.
Select "Other type of secret".
Paste the public key as the secret value:
vbnet
Copy
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEA...your-public-key
Click Next, set the secret name as "my-public-key", and save.
🔹 How to Use These Keys in AWS CodeBuild?
Once your secrets are stored in AWS Secrets Manager, AWS CodeBuild can access them.

✅ Update buildspec.yml to Use These Secrets
yaml
Copy
env:
  secrets-manager:
    SECRET_KEY: "my-secret-key"
    STREAM_INCOMING_PRIVATE_KEY: "my-private-key"
    STREAM_INCOMING_PUBLIC_KEY: "my-public-key"
✅ Use Private Key to SSH into EC2 in buildspec.yml
sh
Copy
echo "$STREAM_INCOMING_PRIVATE_KEY" > ec2-key.pem
chmod 600 ec2-key.pem
ssh -i ec2-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-ip
This retrieves the private key from Secrets Manager and uses it to connect to an EC2 instance.
✅ Final Summary
🔑 Key Name	📌 How to Get It
SECRET_KEY	Generate using Python (secrets module) or Django
my-private-key	Check AWS EC2 Key Pairs or create a new one
my-public-key	Extract from private key or check EC2’s authorized_keys file
AWS Storage	Store in AWS Secrets Manager for security
These keys are essential for security and authentication, and AWS Secrets Manager ensures they are safely stored and accessed in your AWS CodeBuild pipeline.
